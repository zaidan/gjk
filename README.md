# Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) collision detection algorithm
[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/gjk.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gjk)

This package implements the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) collision detection
algorithm for 2D convex objects. It is quite efficient, usually converging
within one or two iterations.

This project was ported from Elm to Haskell (see
[zaidan/elm-collision](https://github.com/zaidan/elm-collision)).
