# Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) collision detection algorithm

[![Build Status](https://github.com/zaidan/gjk/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)][ci]

This package implements the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) collision detection
algorithm for 2D convex objects. It is quite efficient, usually converging
within one or two iterations.

This project was ported from Elm to Haskell (see
[zaidan/elm-collision](https://github.com/zaidan/elm-collision)).
